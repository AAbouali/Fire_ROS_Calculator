Fire Rate of Spread (ROS) Calculator is software built using MatLab to help researchers from wildfire research area to measure the rate of spread (ROS) of a fire propagating over a surface in a laboratory setting.

The primary objective is to calibrate the used camera for filming the fire spread in a way that it would be possible to measure the real distances from the fire images, therefore calculating the ROS. The software has a full GUI (graphical user interface).

There is a compiled version ready to install and use for windows, to install the program you will need to have the MatLab Runtime Libraries R2018a set installed on your computer; however, if you don't, the installer will download it from the internet and install it automatically. If you are using another operating system, you will have to compile your own version, or you can just run the program from the MatLab directly. To do that, download all the files on the source code folder and place them on the MatLab's current directory. Run the program by typing Fire_ROS_Calculator on the command window. 

This program was developed by [ADAI|CEIF](http://www.adai.pt) team (Association for the Development of Industrial Aerodynamics | Center of Studies about Forest Fires), University of Coimbra, Portugal. 

Download The latest Version (v.2.5) from: [Fire ROS Calculator v.2.5](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/releases/download/2.5/Fire_ROS_Calculator_web_v2_5.exe)

There is Manual for the software: [Fire ROS Calculator Manual](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/releases/download/2.5/Fire.ROS.Calculator.manual.v2.5.pdf) and a verification report: [Fire ROS Calculator Verification](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/releases/download/2.5/Fire.ROS.Calculator.Verification.v2.5.pdf)

We are looking forward to developing the program more and also include the ability to calculate the ROS of a fire spreading in an outdoor setting. 

Pull requests are most welcome!
