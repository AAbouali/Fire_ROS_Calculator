Fire Rate of Spread Calculator is a softwere built using MatLab to help the researchers from wildfire research area to measure the rate of spread (ROS) of a fire propagating over a surface in a laboratory setting.

The main objective is to calibrate the used camera for filming the fire spread in a way that it would be possible to measure the real distances from the fire images, therefor calculating the ROS. 

The softwere has a full GUI (graphical user interface). On the last realeased version (v.2.0) there are several assesing tools have bee attached to the program to meke the analyis process faster and easier. 

There is a compiled version ready to use for the windows, to install the program you will need to have the MatLab Runtime Library installed on your computer, however if you don't, the installer will download it from the internet and install it.
In a case that you are using another operation system, you will have to compile your own version or you can just run the code from the MatLab directly. To run the program from MatLab, download all the files on the source code folder and place them on the MatLab's current directory, run the program by typing mian_fun on the caommand window. 

This program was developed by [ADAI|CEIF](http://www.adai.pt) team (Association for the Development of Industrial Aerodynamics | Center of Studies about Forest Fires) in University of Coimbra, Portugal. 

Download The latest Version (v.2.0) from: [Fire ROS Calculator V2](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/releases/download/2.0/Fire_ROS_Calculator_webV2.exe)

There is Manual for the softwere: [Fire ROS Calculator Manual](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/raw/master/Fire%20ROS%20Calculator%20manual%20v2.pdf) and a validtion package: [Fire ROS Calculator Validaiton](https://github.com/AAbouali/Fire_ROS_Calculator/raw/master/Fire%20ROS%20Calculator%20Validation%20v2.pdf)

We are looking forward to develop the program more and include also the ability to calculate the ROS of a fire spreading in field experiments. 

Pull requests are most welcome!
